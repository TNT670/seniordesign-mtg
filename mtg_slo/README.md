## General Info
Statistical Land Optimization for Magic: The Gathering.

This is an iOS / Android App developed during the Spring 2020 Semester of CS4096/7 at Missouri S&T.

Our project aims to find the most optimal balance of colors among lands in a deck.  This app allows for input of a target deck size and set of mana costs to output a set of basic lands that have the highest chance of being able to play its cards on time.
